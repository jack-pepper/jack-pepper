### [Workflow]
- Yoshi gave me crucial information to define my upcoming path. I might start with an internship,
    followed by a startup experience (when it will be ready).

### [Transcendence_Solo]
- Implemented authentication through Google with JWS. Mixing Fastify and Express documentation
    on that matter was NOT fun.

### [Transcendence_Group]
- We had our first meeting. It was very productive and nice.
- As the Product Owner, I will maintain the product backlog, make decisions on features and priorities,
    validates completed work and communicates with "stakeholders" (evaluators, peers).

### [42_Exam_Rank06]
- Not much, but I reviewed the server architecture with Transcendence Solo.

### [Thoughts]
- Тяжкая неделя и тяжелое решение. Знаю, что так правильно, знаю, что надо, но *****.
