## Week of [08-02-2026 - 15-02-2026]

### [Workflow]
- Getting faster.

### [Transcendence_Team]
- Solved conversion issues with my Python script (thanks to [Derek's article: why is it so hard to pdf text extraction?](https://dev.to/derek-compdf/why-is-it-so-hard-to-pdf-text-extraction-k6h?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- Learned to set a Django project. Intimidating at first, but it does not bite.
- Added 42 OAuth (and learned about 42 API)

### [Transcendence_Solo]
- On pause.

### [42_Exam_Rank06]
- On pause.

### [Thoughts]
-  I read with great interest the article [Something Big is Happening (Matt Shumer)](https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening). Unsure on what to conclude though.
