## Week of [02-02-2026 - 09-02-2026]

### [Workflow]
- Priorities changed: the new goal is to validate Transcendence Group before the end of March, as one or our members MUST be done by then.
- Set Ollama on my laptop for LLM local use and management of sensitive or confidential data. Use with: 'ollama run gemma3' (or other model).

### [Transcendence_Group]
- Two new members joined us. So far I am confident we will succeed with this team.
- I set the main priorities and rewamped the backlog to match our goal to turn in a minimal but flawless product.
- Wrote a Python script (connected to local LLM) to prepare 42 docs confidentially for RAG-feeding (conversion from .pdf to .md with manual proofcheck):

    1- Install deps: pip install pymupdf requests
    2- Write Python script (.pdf to .md)
    3- Run it (single file): python3 pdf_to_md_ollama.py <input_file>.pdf gemma3:latest
    4- Run it (batch): python3 pdf_to_md_ollama.py ./pdfs ./md_out --model gemma3:4b --language en --strict

### [Transcendence_Solo]
- Set in pause (non urgent).

### [42_Exam_Rank06]
- Not urgent at this point, but validate ASAP.

### [Resources]
- [Ollama documentation](https://docs.ollama.com/quickstart)

### [Thoughts]
- I am overloaded with other non-coding projects at the same time, so these days do feel like a high-paced and stressful environment.
    For some reasons, my internal caveman does seem to thrive in such. It does coerce you into being creative, organized and fearless.
