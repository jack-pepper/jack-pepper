</p>

I'm currently a **student at 42**, diving deep into low-level programming, system design, and software engineering.

Before stepping into the world of code, I spent more than a decade abroad in **school and preschool education**, as a FLE (French as a Foreign Language) teacher, pedagogical coordinator and trainer, early education private tutor, and finally designer of a bilingual preschool in French Riviera. I founded the company [MARIDO](https://www.marido.fr/).

My background has equipped me with **strong problem-solving, critical thinking, and adaptability skills**. My experience in teaching and cognitive development gives me a unique perspective on learning algorithms, educational technology, and user experience design, which I now explore through programming.
