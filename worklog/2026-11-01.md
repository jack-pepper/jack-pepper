## Week of [11-01-2026 - 17-01-2026]

### [Workflow]

- [SSH] **How to set a new SSH-key:**
    1 (generate): ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "YOUR_EMAIL" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    1.x (if ed25519 not supported): ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YOUR_EMAIL" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    2 (passphrase): set if needed
    3 (start SSH agent and add key): eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    3.x (if RSA used instead, replace id_ed25519 by id_rsa)
    4 (copy public key):
        [Linux] cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        [Windows] cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
        [MacOS] pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    5 (add public key to GitHub) GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key → paste → Add
    6 (test SSH connection) ssh -T git@github.com
    7 (make the repo use SSH remote) git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USER/YOUR_REPO.git

### [42_Collaborative_Resume] (with: Yahya)
- Had mock interviews
- Prepared a French resume for my teammate.
- Done with 100%. One step closer to completing 42 Common Core!

### [Transcendence_Solo]
- Designed a working authentification system with simple frontend validation : (html) pattern and maxlength (320 for email, 128 for password) and (js) form.checkValidity().
- Implemented an (unsafe) authentification system with IndexedDB and built a wrapper API. Learned a lot about databases. 
- Implemented a Node.js server with Fastify and set it up to serve the website. Added a SQLite3 database and started migrating the authentification system from IndexedDB.
- Refactored CSS to offer four (poorly sketched) switchables themes (light/dark/sunrise/sunset)
- Filled (with the help of Copilot) the section containers with relevant temporary data... and cleaned the mess.

- [NodeJS] Launch with: node app/backend/server.mjs

### [Transcendence_Group]
- Agreed on working together with two fellow students.
- Set a Slack group and an .xls file with subject requirements, tasks list, roles repartition and automatic points calculator

### [Misc]
- [Languages] 20-day streaks in Babbel (English) and Chinese Buddy (Mandarine Chinese). I noticed my understanding of spoken Chinese has improved.
- [Suno_AI] The "Nashi" project is finally done. Varlam goes on. 

### [Thoughts]
- While AI feels for many as Freud's "fourth wound" and "narcissistic insult", never had we such a direct access to the noosphere than with Suno! A prayer came true:

~ Demain chacun sera poète
~ Et maître de sa propre vie
~ Et enfin les ramasse-miettes
~ Prendront le nom de colibris.
