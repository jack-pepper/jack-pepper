## Week of [18-01-2026 - 25-01-2026]

### [Workflow]
- It would be great to automate publishing this work log on Github. Draft: show the previous week's log, with a link to the full document.
- I am unsure whether creating a search system would be worth it, but I wll keep the idea just in case.
- As my schedule *should* be more stable for a couple of months, I can reorganise my workflow for more efficiency.
- Current goals before summer: 1- finish 42 Common Core (Transcendence Group + Exam); 2- finish Transcendence Solo; 3- define what's next!

### [Transcendence_Solo]
- Started implementing the chat. Websockets are working, time to store the conversations in DB. 
- Added a SQL schema for DB whose existence is assessed at startup. I might need to set a migration table later to handle version update.
- Refactored the project for modularity and clarity. 
- Finally set a 're' alias to recompile the project properly with one command:
    `
    npx tsc --build ./config/tsconfig.base.json --force
    npx tsc -p app/frontend/tsconfig.json
    npx tsc -p app/backend/tsconfig.json
    npx tsx app/backend/src/server.mjs'
    `

- [Reminder] To set an alias: 1. code ~/.zshrc 2. add alias re='{my commands}' 3. source ~/zshrc
- [Reminder] An EventListener supports Entry if applied on form element (instead of send button) and is good for accessibility. 
- [Reminder] Defining an interface can help with destructuration type errors with TypeScript.

### [Transcendence_Group]
- Suggested an idea for the project. As each of us is highly interested in implementing a RAG and a LLM, it should cover it without too much
    replication of my Transcendence Solo project. Another stack would be nice.
- Defined with my partners a meeting date.

### [42_Exam_Rank06]
- Reviewed the basics of a server.

### [Thoughts]
- 解 (xiè, hexagramme 40 du Yi King).
